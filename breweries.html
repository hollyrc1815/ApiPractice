	      <p class="card-text">Humperdinks Brewpubs in the DFW Metroplex are locally owned and "humpin' to please" since 1976. A Dallas institution for serious comfort food, a lively bar scene. As the first family of Brewpubs in 1995 (when brewing beer yourself wasn't cool), we were ahead of the craft brewery trend.</p>

	      <p class="card-text">When Brewmaster Matt Ehinger married Courtney McHugh in 2001, he instantly became part of a large, tight-knit, fun loving family. The current McHugh family consist of mom and dad, three sisters, one brother, three brother in laws, one sister in law and 11 grandkids!

		  But as in all families, especially ones with a lot of sisters, it can sometimes be hard to keep the peace. Matt quickly learned that the best way to make family gatherings run smoothly was to supply everyone with his home-brewed beer. The sisters, and the brothers, learned to be less ‘bitter’ with every sip of beer.

          As the years went on, the family continued to grow, the beer continued to flow, and an idea was hatched for a family owned brewery utilizing everyone’s different talents and skills.

	      <p class="card-text">Cellarman's was openend in 1998 as a small local 100 seat Pub with 5 draught beers and a small menu. We have developed a loyal following over the years that has allowed us to expand to 200 seats 33 draughts, 100 bottle beers and a large menu. The newest addition is our 1400 sq ft two story Brew House where we brew up creative craft beers and sodas. One thing that hasn't changed is our philosophy.

		  Our Philosophy: Be different, try new things and never sacrifice quality. Our passion is Craft Beer “Beer handcrafted by smaller breweries that pay uncommon attention to detail, quality, flavor and freshness.” Our favorite beer is the one we haven’t tried yet. That’s why we offer the largest selection of fine beers in the area. We keep it new and fresh by bringing in new beers from time to time. The unique, hand-crafted theme flows right into the kitchen with our Wood-Fired Stone Oven that cooks great gourmet pizza’s and other fine fare. We also offer over 200 spirits, a single malt scotch bar, highly rated wines and specialty mixed drinks. So order what you like and if you have any questions or would like a recommendation ask our friendly staff. 

		  We understand that you have many choices in dining. Thank you for choosing us and we will do our best to take care of you and make sure you have a great time.</p>
